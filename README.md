### CPU
Generally speaking you want to prioritize clock speed over core count, with no fewer than i7 for 2080 Super, i5 for a 2060. Check perforamnce hierarchies-https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cpu-hierarchy,4312.html. In my build probably a i7 10700k or Ryzen 7 3700X.

**Core Count**: Important for parallelizable workloads such as rendering. Note that hyperthreading/multithreading enable the creation of multiple logical cores within a single physical core. Note that as a GPU can process more, the CPU can bottleneck performance. For a higher performance GPU, a corresponding high performance CPU is important. You can check calculators like (https://pc-builds.com/calculator/) to ensure you're not bottlenecking too greatly. Note that games that run around 1080p are usually going to be using a single core, and will rely on single core clock speed. It's important to note that generally speaking, the more cores that are packed onto a processer, the lower single core clock speeds will be. AMD generally has higher core count with lower boost frequencies, whereas Intel has lower core count with higher boost frequencies. Currently very few games utilize more than 4 cores. 

**Clock Speed**: How many cycles a CPU can perform per second. 

**Boost Clock**: Boosts cores that are running cooler to run a higher clock speed while still staying in acceptable limits.

**TDP**: Short for thermal design power, amount of heat that the CPU is expected to produce when under load. 

**PCIe4.0**: Streamlines loading of upcoming game data, only important for loading single player games. 

### Motherboard
Motherboards have lots of different components including a CPU socket, PCIe expansion slot, M.2 slots for M.2 SSDs, fan headers, front panel headers, SATA ports for SATA SSDs or HDDs, RAM slots, power connectors, and wifi antenna connectors. Choosing a motherboard doesn't affect frame rate, but does affect what features your PC is capable of supporting, reliability, and other parts you may choose.

**Motherboard + CPU Compatibility**: Motherboard must have the same socket type as the CPU. 

**Motherboard + Case Compatibility**: Your motherboard must fit in your case. Generally speaking you're looking at a ATX full standard sized motherboard that fits in a mid tower or full tower case.

**Motherboard + RAM Compatibility**: Motherbaord must support current RAM type (DDR4), and RAM speed. Your installed RAM must not exceed the maximum RAM capacity specified by the motherboard. Make sure you buy a motherboard with 4 RAM slots.

**Motherboard brands**: The most reliable brands are typical Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, and ASRock.

### RAM
**DIMM**: Dual inline memory module, two 64 bit interfaces. 

**SDRAM**: Synchronous dynamic random access memory

**Data Rate**: Number of times per second that a module sends and receives data. DDR (Double data rate) frequency is twice its clock frequency. DDR4 is the 4th generation of DDR memory.

**Rank**: Collection of ICs that connects to the RAM. 

**CAS Latency**: Column access strobe, number of clock cycles that pass between when an instruction is given, and when the information is made available. Interestingly enough, higher speeds of RAM always trump higher latency, though for identical DRs, you should choose fastest latency.

**Timing**: Number sets that indicate the number of clock cycles required to perform a variety of actions. 

**EEPROM**: Electrically erasable programmable read only memory. XMP, or extreme memory profiles, are higher performance specs placed into RAM.
