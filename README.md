### CPU
Generally speaking you want to prioritize clock speed over core count, with no fewer than i7 for 2080 Super, i5 for a 2060. Check perforamnce hierarchies-https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cpu-hierarchy,4312.html

**Core Count**: Important for parallelizable workloads such as rendering. Note that hyperthreading/multithreading enable the creation of multiple logical cores within a single physical core. Note that as a GPU can process more, the CPU can bottleneck performance. For a higher performance GPU, a corresponding high performance CPU is important. You can check calculators like (https://pc-builds.com/calculator/) to ensure you're not bottlenecking too greatly. Note that games that run around 1080p are usually going to be using a single core, and will rely on single core clock speed. It's important to note that generally speaking, the more cores that are packed onto a processer, the lower single core clock speeds will be. AMD generally has higher core count with lower boost frequencies, whereas Intel has lower core count with higher boost frequencies. Currently very few games utilize more than 4 cores. 

**Clock Speed**: How many cycles a CPU can perform per second. 

**Boost Clock**: Boosts cores that are running cooler to run a higher clock speed while still staying in acceptable limits.

**TDP**: Short for thermal design power, amount of heat that the CPU is expected to produce when under load. 

**PCIe4.0**: Streamlines loading of upcoming game data, only important
